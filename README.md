## Notes:
- https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/API/Runtime/Engine/Subsystems/UEngineSubsystem?application_version=5.4
> UEngineSubsystems are dynamic and will be initialized when the module is loaded if necessary. This means that after StartupModule() is called on the module containing a subsystem, the subsystem collection with instantiate and initialize the subsystem **automatically**. If the subsystem collection is created post module load then the instances will be created at collection initialization time.
